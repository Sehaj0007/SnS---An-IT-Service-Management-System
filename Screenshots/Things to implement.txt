From here, you can choose what to work on next to polish your project and make it even more impressive. Here are a few ideas, in order of what I'd recommend:

Refine the UI/UX:

Add loading indicators: Show a spinner while the services or components are being fetched from the backend.

Improve user feedback: Show more detailed messages on login failure or success.

Design the "Know More" pages: Create simple pages that show more details about each of your main services.

Implement the Consultancy Appointment Booking:

You already have the frontend design concept for this.

You would repeat the same pattern we've learned: create the Java Entity/Repository/Controller for appointments, and then build a React component with a form to submit the data.

User Profile/Order History:

Create a new page where a logged-in user can see a list of all the custom PCs they have ordered in the past. This would involve creating a new secure endpoint on your backend to fetch orders for a specific user.

Deployment:

The final step for any project is to deploy it to the internet so others can use it. This is a more advanced topic, but it's the ultimate goal.
